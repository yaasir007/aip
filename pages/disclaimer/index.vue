      <h3>17.1. Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Obligations</h3>
      <p>Your advertisement must comply with all relevant legal and regulatory obligations, including
      but not limited to the requirements set forth under applicable property laws and consumer
      protection standards. Specifically, the advertisement must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detailed Description: Provide a thorough and accurate description of the property,
        including its location, physical composition (e.g., number of rooms, size, etc.), its
        parts (e.g., garden, pool, garage), and any furnishings included. All information must
        align with the factual details of the property and meet the required standards of clarity
        and transparency.</li>
        <li>Accuracy in Representation: The advertisement must accurately represent the
        property as it exists and cannot mislead potential buyers or renters regarding the
        nature or condition of the property.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>17.2. Content Restrictions and Permissions</h3>
      <p>The advertisement may include only images and/or plans directly related to the property
      being advertised, such as photographs or blueprints. It must also:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistency in Property Presentation: Ensure that the advertisement consistently
        presents the same property and its components for the entire duration of the
        publication. For example, you may not alter the advertisement's content to promote
        different sections of the property (e.g., switching from advertising the entire villa to
        advertising just a portion, such as the first storey, without prior notification).</li>
        <li>Rates Disclosure: Clearly display the rates for the rental or sale of the property.
        Under no circumstances should the advertisement feature misleading rates, such as
        offering an unrealistic "zero" or "very low" price, which could be construed as
        deceptive or unlawful.</li>
        <li>Intellectual Property Compliance: Ensure that any images, photographs, plans, or
        other content used in the advertisement are either owned by you or for which you
        hold all necessary rights, licenses, or authorizations, including but not limited to
        reproduction rights, royalties, and permissions for use. You must not infringe on any
        intellectual property rights in the publication of your ad.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>17.3. Ad Maintenance and Updates</h3>
      <p>Your advertisement must be kept updated regularly to ensure that all information remains
      accurate, complete, and reflective of the property's status. Failure to maintain the
      advertisement may result in its removal from the Website at our discretion.</p>
      <h3>17.4. Uniqueness of Advertisements</h3>
      <p>Each property may only have one advertisement listing at any given time. Duplicate listings
      offering identical properties at the same price are strictly prohibited. You may not create
      multiple ads for the same property with similar or identical content.</p>
